Creates four example trees and validates them. Three are the examples given in 
the project assignment and will report, "X tree is true" while one is an
incorrect tree that will report "FalseTree is false" along with a message
indicating why.

Because of the way trees are created, and the fact that you give the tree's
root to the validation method, the concept of connectedness doesn't apply. It
should be impossible to create an unconnected tree.
